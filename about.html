            I believe every parent has the power to support their child's
            natural development—they just need to know *what to do*. And
            that’s exactly where my journey to write this book began.

            My most important title is "Nana."

          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            When my grandson was born in another country, I suddenly found
            myself trying to guide my daughter through the crucial stages of
            his mobility milestone development from thousands of miles away.
            It was then I realized that even with decades of professional
            experience, I needed a clear, practical guide—a blueprint—to help
            her (and him) succeed from a distance. I had to distill my 35
            years of knowledge into a simple, actionable system.

          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            That system is now this book.

            Why This Guidance Matters
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            As Swedens's leading expert in pediatric musculoskeletal
            health and Sweden’s most experienced practitioner in this area,
            I’ve spent the last 35 years focused exclusively on pregnant
            women, infants, children, and adolescents. My work has shown me
            that the musculoskeletal care these groups need—the foundation for
            strong motor development—is often missed in standard primary care.
            My practice, research, and education are dedicated to filling that
            critical gap.

          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            My philosophy combines high-level professional knowledge with the
            practical, reassuring approach you deserve:

            My research has centered on complex issues like the relationship
            between cervical spine dysfunction and headaches in children. Now,
            I’m focused on translating that high-level expertise into
            accessible, actionable guidance for you. This book is the
            culmination of three decades of work and a grandmother's love—it’s
            the definitive guide to unlocking your baby’s full physical
            potential.
